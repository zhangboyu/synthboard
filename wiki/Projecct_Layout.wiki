= Introduction =
There are several steps that will be followed to implement this project.

==1) Interface the keyboard with the board ==
The first step here is to first get one key working correctly. Once one is working, the other key strokes will be fairly straightforward. From what I've seen, there is a timer counting, waiting for a key stroke input. Each key has it's own code. There is both a key pressed and key released code. The code for "5" being pressed is 2E while the release key is F0, 2E. The F part indicates that it was being released.

==2) Sound output ==
The next step will be to output sound from the board based on the key being pressed. There is a connection for standard sound output. The video resource shows someone using audio from an SD card.

==3) Monitor Interface ==
Once 1 & 2 are Complete, the third step is having the monitor show the keys that are pressed. This is not necessary for the project but will be a nice addition showing when keys are pressed. This is more of a bell or whistle rather than a requirement.
